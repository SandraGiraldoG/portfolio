      <div class="container">

        <p>15 years ago I was living in my hometown Pensilvania, Colombia. It is a tiny town in the middle of the Andes. At that time a new pizza place opened, everyone was nuts about it, and of course, little me went to try this famous pizza they were making.</p>
        <p>I remember just going wow! the pizza was the best one I’ve ever had. There was this flavor I couldn’t put into words and nobody could tell me what it was. A few months ago, I went back to this pizzeria. By then I had eaten pizza hundreds of times in different places around the world and guess what? this mysterious ingredient was still there. Of course, once again I tried to identify this flavor, but once again I failed. I loved this ingredient and I wanted to know what it was so I could use it at home in my own pizza and other dishes. So, I decided to create a new feature that would help me with this whole mysterious ingredient situation. I will tell you all about it but first, let me tell you a little bit about Mapstr. </p>

        <h2 class="mapstr">What is Mapstr?</h2>
        <p>Mapstr is a French mobile application founded in 2014 by Sébastien Caron. It lets you save and organize your favorite places: restaurants, bars, coffee shops, museums, etc. It also lets you connect with your friends and see their favorite places. The application is pretty cool and its community is growing. In 2019, it had 1.4 million users around the world.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">“The app Google Maps forgot to do! Among the hundreds of apps that are emerging every week, we bet it will soon be a must-have in our smartphone.” — VANITY FAIR</blockquote>


        <p>Remember the mysterious ingredient story? well, Mapstr is the app I created my feature for. It consists of identifying a dish you liked at a restaurant and showing you the recipe with the ingredients for it. It also suggests some drinks that go well with it. All of this by simply taking a picture.</p>

        <h2 class="mapstr">Research</h2>
        <p>Before moving on ideation, I did some research about the potential this feature could have. I found out there isn’t anything with the same functionality in the market, so no direct competitors for my feature (nice!). Then, I asked people if they would use it and all of them said they totally would (nice!!) as long as they didn’t have to pay for it (okay).</p>

        <h2 class="mapstr">Ideation</h2>
        <p>With this information in hand, I moved forward with the ideation process and I started sketching the elements needed for this feature. I also used mid-fi wireframes to illustrate the best way to incorporate my feature in the Master application without interrupting the existing navigation flow. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <figure class="img-container">
          <img src="../assets/images/add-a-feature/lo-fi-wireframes.jpeg" class="img-fluid text-center" alt="Responsive image">
          <figcaption class="text-muted">Lo-fi wireframes for feature flow</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <p>At this point, it seemed simple and straightforward to integrate my feature into the Mapstr app, but after a deeper analysis, ideation sessions, and design critiques from my colleagues, I realized there was still a long way to go.</p>
        <p>I had to add a way for people to look at their saved recipes and to be able to edit them using different tags and comments. I made the saved recipes accessible from the left navigation bar, but it was not very clear what would happen when the user clicked on them, so I had to make this more intuitive.</p>

        <h2 class="mapstr">Hi-Fi & Prototype</h2>
        <p>After I had identified what needed to be done next for my feature in order to be more clear and more accessible, I dived into the visual design documentation Mapstr brand was made of. I recognized their atomic design elements, their visual identity, and the yellow color signature. Finally, I moved into UI and hi-fi prototyping and you can interact with it at the end of this post.</p>

          <figcaption class="text-muted">Actual mapstr flow</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

        <div class="container">
          <h4 class="mapstr">Adding a recipe</h4>
          <p>I decided to start my feature flow once the user had indicated he is in the restaurant.</p>
          <ul class="mapstr">
            <li>I replaced the “Reserve” button (since he doesn’t need it because he is already in the restaurant) by a “Recipe” button.</li>
            <li>The user takes a picture of his dish, the app recognizes it and shows the recipe’s main information: short description, cooking time, rating, and the level of difficulty.</li>
            <li>The user can access the detailed information (ingredients, steps and drink suggestions) for the recipe by clicking on the “See recipe” button.</li>
            <li>The user saves the recipe by clicking in save and selecting at least one tag (like when adding a place in the Mapstr app).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <figure class="img-container">
            <img src="../assets/images/add-a-feature/saving-recipe.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">Actual mapstr flow</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <h4 class="mapstr">Accessing a saved recipe:</h4>
          <p>The user can access his saved recipes from the left navigation bar. He can either see all the recipes or click on a visible tag. Here I didn’t want to show all the recipe tags so I added a “See all” button. The reason for this is because at some point the user will have so many recipe tags that he won’t be able to see his place tags (the main Mapstr feature) without having to scroll.</p>
          <ul class="mapstr">
            <li>He can easily navigate from one tag to another.</li>
            <li>He can see the recipe’s information, the drinks that go well with it and adjust the portions needed.</li>
            <li>He can modify the number of portions.</li>
            <li>He can edit the recipe by choosing tags on it or adding comments.</li>
            <li>He can delete a recipe.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <div class="container">
            <figure class="img-container">
              <img src="../assets/images/add-a-feature/accesing-saved-recipe.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">Actual mapstr flow</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <div class="container">
            <h4 class="mapstr">Bookmarking a recipe:</h4>
            <p>Once the user has taken a picture of a dish he will have the option to just bookmark* it (and add tags and comments later) by clicking on a bookmark icon or save it by clicking on “Save” and adding tags to it.</p>
            <p>*The bookmark option didn’t make it to the final prototype. Keep reading to know why.</p>

            <h2 class="mapstr">Key learnings</h2>
            <p>With a first hi-fi prototype, I ran a usability test and here are the main take-outs.</p>

            <ul class="mapstr">
              <li>100% of the tested participants liked the feature.</li>
              <li>80% would use it when going out to restaurants.</li>
              <li>Nobody understood the difference between bookmark a recipe and save a recipe.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So, I had to iterate in the last element and remove the bookmark option. The result was:</p>
            <p>Once the user has taken a picture of a dish, it will automatically be registered in the application even if he doesn’t go in the “Save” process. It will be registered on the recipes page and he can access it by clicking in the library icon located in the top right of the screen. Here he can:</p>

            <ul class="mapstr">
              <li>Save the recipe, by choosing its tags and adding comments.</li>
              <li>Share it with friends.</li>
              <li>Delete it forever.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="container">
            <figure class="img-container">
              <img src="../assets/images/add-a-feature/checked-recipes.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">Actual mapstr flow</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <div class="container">
            <p>After I changed this, my feature did much better. I ran a second usability test and 80% of the participants found it useful, easy to understand and to use.</p>
            <h4 class="mapstr">The next steps for my feature are:</h4>
            <ul ul class="mapstr">
              <li>Do usability tests with more participants to have a bigger picture of the feature use.</li>
              <li>Talk with restaurant chefs and owners to know if they would be okay to share their dishes recipes through Mapstr.</li>
              <li>Talk with wine producers and create partnerships.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I loved working on this feature — not only because I am a food lover — but also because I truly believe it could change people’s lives, well, at least mine since I would fiiiiinally be able to identify the mysterious ingredient that makes the pizza in my hometown so special.</p>

            <h5>Note:</h5> <p>I do not work for Mapstr. I created this feature and did this UX case study as part of my Ironhack Paris Bootcamp in April 2020.</p>
